# Autonomous Network Of Modelled Lifeforms and Yoked-Organisms

## Introduction 👋
The Autonomous Network Of Modelled Lifeforms and Yoked-Organisms (ANOMALY) is a research project focused on developing a simulation of an ecosystem using Unity 3D and Python. The project aims to create a self-sustaining virtual environment in which different lifeforms and organisms interact with each other and their environment.

## Objectives 🎯

The ANOMALY project aims to create an open-source simulation platform for modeling complex ecosystems and creating artificial organisms. Specific objectives include:

+ Providing a realistic simulation environment for creating complex ecosystems. 🌳🌲🌿
+ Enabling the modeling of artificial organisms with realistic behaviors and characteristics. 🦠🐟🐦🐺
+ Integrating data analysis tools for visualization and interpretation of simulation results. 📊📈
+ Enabling community collaboration and contribution through an open-source platform. 👥💻🤝

## Main Features 🚀

The main features of the ANOMALY platform include:

+ Simulation environment: providing a realistic simulation environment for ecosystem modeling, including geography, topography, weather conditions, day/night cycles, seasons, etc. 🌎🌦️🌗🌡️
+ Organism modeling: enabling the modeling of artificial organisms with realistic behaviors and characteristics, including reproduction, growth, metabolism, hunting and fleeing, cooperation, competition, etc. 🐾🌱🌿🌾
+ Data analysis: integrating data analysis tools for visualization and interpretation of simulation results, including graphs and data tables. 📈📊📉
+ Community collaboration: enabling community collaboration and contribution through an open-source platform, including the ability to share ecosystem and organism models, add features, report bugs, propose improvements, etc. 👥💬💻📣

## Technical Constraints 🗜️

The ANOMALY project will be developed using Unity 3D and the C# scripting language for the graphical interface and environment modeling. Python will be used for simulation algorithm development and data analysis. Technical constraints include:

+ Use of Unity 3D for creating the user interface, modeling environments, and simulating behaviors. 🎮🕹️
+ Use of C# for programming the user interface and modeling environments. 🖥️💻
+ Use of Python for programming simulation algorithms and data analysis. 🐍📊
+ Compatibility with major operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. 💻🖥️🐧
+ Use of open-source for project development. 🆓📂

## How It Works ⚙️
ANOMALY is built on Unity 3D, a powerful game engine that allows for the creation of highly realistic 3D environments. The ecosystem is populated by different lifeforms and organisms, each with their own characteristics and behaviors. Python scripts are used to simulate the behavior of these lifeforms and organisms, including their movements, interactions, and responses to environmental stimuli.
The ecosystem is designed to be self-sustaining, with each organism fulfilling its own needs while also contributing to the larger ecosystem. The environment includes features such as weather patterns, day and night cycles, and various types of terrain to provide a realistic and varied ecosystem for the lifeforms and organisms.

## Getting Started 💡
To get started with ANOMALY, first, clone or download the repository. Then, install Unity 3D and Python if you haven't already. Open the Unity project and start exploring the ecosystem. You can modify the behavior of the lifeforms and organisms by editing the Python scripts.

## Development Timeline 📅
